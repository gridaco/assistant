# Component view
> A code preview widget that displays extra component's information such as storybook url, documentation url, and local code directory path, etc..


this is not customizable yet. but will engineered with extensibility.


## How it works
1. get selected layer
2. check if selected layer is a component or an instance.
3. find if data to display exists on a master component.
4. display data if exists. else, display input.
