# Grdia Assistant plugin (figma to flutter & react)

> Any design to high quality code, with live preview.

![Grida figma to code demo with live preview](docs/gifs/assistant-demo-2021.0.1.gif)

- ✅ Human readable code generation.
- ✅ Code generation built with CoLI, developed especially for assistant usage, ensuring the best code generation quality.
- ✅ Slots support (Component with parameters)
- ✅ Modularized code generation / readability. All production level code, code beign generated as Functions, Varables, Ect..
- ✅ Design Linting - Visaully makes sence, Structure made sence.
- ✅ Cloud Resource Copy. Copy your resource in 1 second. (No need to download images and move under `res/`)
- ✅ Live preview via [console](https://console.grida.co) - compiles output source remotely makes design to living application within seconds
- ✅ Context detection - Grida assistant understands the design, than converts it into a hight quality code. we don't generate rect and text code for a button. We generate button code for a button.

## Devmode

WIP

## Usage

> Install figma plugin via below link. Note that the published plugin is always behind few new features behind this repository. For trying out the latest and mindblowing features, please build from your local environment directly.

Install via figma plugin [link here](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/896445082033423994).

### Cloning and running the project:

> - We use yarn workspace for maintaining this project as monorepo.
> - Some additional steps are required to run this project properly.

```shell
# [REQUIRED] we use git submodules for `packages/`. you have to explicitly execute this command instead default clone.
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gridaco/assistant.git

cd assistant

# [REQUIRED] Yarn will install dependencies, link packages, and generate compiled code of packages, so it can be referenced by root projects.
yarn

# [OPTIONAL 1] Run figma plugin in dev mode (use localhost server) (recommanded)
yarn figma

# [OPTIONAL 1-2] Run figma plugin in dev mode (native)
yarn figma-native

# [OPTIONAL 2] Run sketch plugin in dev mode
yarn sketch

# [OPTIONAL 3 & Contributors only] Run plugin ui in webdev mode
yarn web
# visit http://localhost:3303/init-webdev to work on browser
```

_Soon as the subpackages are released as stable, we will remove git submodule dependency for ease of use. until then, this will be the primary repository and all the edits and PRs will be caused by this project._ - [Learn more here](https://github.com/bridgedxyz/.github/blob/main/contributing/working-with-submodules.md)

> Sometimes, when pulling this repo from remote, if new submodule package is added, you'll need to run below command to pull with updated submodules (we recommand you to know what this command actually does in a nut shell.)

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)

## Flutter code builder

flutter widget builder is done by [figma/flutter](/flutter) and the core builder is powered by [Grida dynamic](https://github.com/bridgedxyz/dynamic)

- [figma/flutter](/figma/src/flutter)
- [grida/flutter-builder](https://github.com/bridgedxyz/flutter-builder)
- [grida/dynamic](https://github.com/bridgedxyz/dynamic)
- ✅ `Theme.of` Textstyle support
- ✅ `Colors.` Color support
- ✅ Slots support (not static content)
- ✅ Modularized builder functions - (not all-in-one widget tree)
- ✅ Formatted Dart code
- ✅ Best code quality (I Assure,) in this planet

## Console & Cloud integrations

> Watch the demo on our [website](https://grida.co)

Grida console integrated with assistant enables you to manage your design's content in one place. even if text, image is updated, you don't need to update your code. our cloud service got your back.

Learn more at [console repository](https://github.com/gridaco/console.grida.co)

## UI Element Detection

> Rule based button / input / icon detection with [@reflect-ui/detection](./packages/detection)
> Higher quality ML based detection available at [Grida's context engine](https://github.com/bridgedxyz/context)
